       " 'Description': 'The Gutter Diaries: Directed by Josh Whittall. With Reese Alexander, Pat Alguire, Coltin Argue, Kristina Barr. Structured as four stories and set in Vancouver, we follow four individuals going through hard times, trying to find their way through life. But it\\'s a bumpy road with problems and addictions lurking around each corner. As each tale unfolds we begin to learn how directly or indirectly each person affects one another. TK, is a lost soul, addicted to drugs and unable to remember anything about himself, including his own name. On their way to score, TK makes eye contact with a stranger passing by in a car, who ends up jumping out and chasing after him and his friends. The junkies get away, but not before the stranger shouts \"Tom!\" leaving a bewildered TK full of questions and now on a search for answers. Bryan is a grade eleven high-school teacher obsessed with one of his students, Karen. Knowing full well of the risks and ramifications if he acts on his urges, he begins searching for excitement in all the wrong places. Will Bryan cross the line? Alice, a prostitute, is addicted to drugs and simply waiting to die. Her child waits at home with her careless, drug addicted, pimp boyfriend. What does a woman do that\\'s been forgotten by society and made poor choices her whole life? Last is Karen, the student Bryan is obsessed with. She appears to have everything. She\\'s beautiful, smart, and hangs with the in crowd. But we quickly learn nothing\\'s as it seems.'}"
